# Resilience PC Game

A PC game developed by Resilience, Inc. with the goal of helping students learn and master the SEL curriculum in a fun and interactive manner.

The game currently consists of one level broken up into four separate stages. The player is asked two questions in between each stage. Note that the stages are currently called "levels" in the code; this might change in the future. We hope to eventually have 12 levels, each corresponding to a module of the SELENA curriculum.
